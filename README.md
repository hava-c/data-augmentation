# Data Augmentation

The objective of this project is to explore and compare mul- tiple solutions for the problem of data augmentation in the medical do- main. The generation of artificial training data for machine learning tasks can be very useful in situations where researchers face imbalanced data sets or insufficient number of observations, and previous work has already shown the effectiveness of simple augmentation techniques such as crop- ping, and rotating images. In this work we focus on data augmentation using generative models and experiment with autoencoders, variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.

The file `Data_Augmentation.ipynb` can be opened using Google Colab where all necessary librairies and dependencies are available and ready to be used.
